**Built interactive dashboards using:**  
-Pivot Tables to summarize churn metrics by segments.  
-Charts (bar, pie, and Pareto charts) to visualize key insights.  
-Formulas to calculate averages, percentages, and other KPIs.  

**Highlighted actionable insights, such as:**  
-Majority of churned customers are on month-to-month contracts.  
-Competitor offers and dissatisfaction are the top churn reasons.  

## Main outcomes of the analysis:  
-The churn rate is 28.88%, with most churned customers being high-value users consuming more than 3GB/month (66.82%) and paying monthly charges >21 euros (83.76%).  
-The primary churn drivers are competitor offers (45.51%), including better pricing and devices, along with internal factors like dissatisfaction (16.17%) and poor service attitude (18.22%).  
-High-value customers with total charges >1,000 euros represent a critical segment for retention, as they are significant contributors to revenue but show vulnerability to churn.  
-Competitive pricing, premium device offers, improved service quality, and targeted retention campaigns for high-data consumers are essential to reduce churn and retain high-value customers.  

## Recommendations:  
-Prioritize retention of high-value customers (>21 euros monthly charges) with personalized loyalty programs and competitive offers.  
-Address competition by introducing data-rich plans and bundling premium devices with attractive pricing.  
-Enhance customer service by improving staff training and addressing dissatisfaction promptly.  
-Target high-data consumers (>3GB/month) with bonus data and flexible plans.  
-Launch targeted win-back campaigns for churned customers, focusing on high-value segments (>1,000 euros total charges).
